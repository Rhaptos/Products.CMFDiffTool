Static Implementation Tests
===========================
 	
Let's just make sure that our static views are working as expected.
	
The first thing we need to do is to make sure the interfaces are
being correctly implemented::
 	
    >>> from Products.CMFDiffTool.ChangeSet import ChangeSet
    >>> ChangeSet.meta_type == 'Change Set'
    True
    >>> ChangeSet.portal_type == 'ChangeSet'
    True
